        <h1>BAGUIO CITY: BRIEF HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
            Baguio's history began during the Spanish era. Early explorers like Juan Salcedo and Don Q.M. Quirante were drawn to the area for its economic potential. 
            Although the Spaniards struggled to pacify the Igorots, Commandante de Galvey established the province of Benguet in 1846. The Spanish built churches, schools, and roads, helping to create a structured community.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the early 1900s, the Americans took control and made Baguio the capital of Benguet. Under architect Daniel Burnham's guidance, the city was designed as a "Garden City." This plan laid the foundation for Baguio's urban development.
            <br>
            <br>
            World War II brought chaos to Baguio as Japanese forces attacked. Despite the bombing of Camp John Hay, the local government continued to function. 
            The city was liberated on April 27, 1945. After the war, Baguio grew into a key commercial and educational center in Northern Luzon while retaining its title as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines."
            <br>
            <br>
            In July 1990, a powerful earthquake struck Baguio and caused widespread destruction. The city has since recovered and remains a popular destination for tourists. 
            In 2017, UNESCO recognized Baguio as one of the Creative Cities in the Crafts and Folk Art category, showcasing its rich culture and heritage.</p>
